        <h1>About of Cambodia</h1>
        <p>Cambodia is a Southeast Asian nation whose landscape spans low-lying plains, the Mekong Delta, mountains and
            Gulf of
            Thailand coastline. Phnom Penh, its capital, is home to the art deco Central Market, glittering Royal Palace
            and the
            National Museum's historical and archaeological exhibits. In the country's northwest are the ruins of Angkor
            Wat, a
            massive stone temple complex built during the Khmer Empire.</p>

                <h2>Travel in Cambodia</h2>
                <p>Be aware of your surroundings at all times and to be extra vigilant when displaying items like
                    jewelry, bags and cell
                    phones in public. Violent crime, such as sexual assault and homicide, is common, sometimes against
                    foreigners. Do not
                    physically resist any robbery attempt. Use caution when walking or driving at night. You will need a
                    valid passport and a Cambodian visa to enter Cambodia. Tourist and business visas are valid for one
                    month from the date of entry into Cambodia. Cambodia offers on-line visa processing.</p>
